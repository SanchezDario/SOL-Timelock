 # Timelock app
Lock any ERC20 Tokens without extra fees
Also works with tokens which have tokenomics such as fee on transfer
In order to lock tokens you need to allow the smart contract to use your tokens by approving first

Unpreventable Vulnerability:
The risk is on the block.timestamp as the timestamp can be manipulated by miners. This is unpreventable but not a drama at all so therefore it's a very low vulnerability
